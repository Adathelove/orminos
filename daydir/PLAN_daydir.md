# Step Summary

Stabilize the DayDir backend into its first complete, validated, and documented form.

## Step 1

Define and finalize the DayDir schema v1, including required fields and `schema_version`.

## Step 2

Implement strict override-first pathing and validation rules for root, daydir names, and allowed directory creation.

## Step 3

Align DayDir backend behavior with the JSON backend to ensure identical load/save semantics and interface guarantees.
